# Use Cases

The data store behind Upstash is compatible with almost all Redis® API. So you can use Upstash for the Redis®' popular use cases such as:

- General caching
- Session caching
- Leaderboards
- Queues
- Usage metering (counting)
- Content filtering

Check Salvatore's [blog](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html) post. You can find lots of similar articles about the common use cases of Redis. But what makes Upstash different than other hosted Redis solutions is its serverless approach.

- You do not deal with servers.
- You pay only when you use.
